with this pokedex you can search pokemon by name etc.Also change light modes for easier viewing. All the data for contents is from pokeapi. technologies that were used was html css and javascript pulling data from api and putting it onto the screen.
no install required.
to find the pokemon youre looking for just search at the top of the screen.

thanks again to pokeapi.co and github for the images and data to make this possible
